# My solutions to [cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)

This is very rough and I'd (almost) never write production code like this.

## TODO / Further study

- RSA
  - Proof of correctness for RSA algorithm
  - Intuitive understanding of how challenge 42 works
  - Does RSA mostly work with large composite numbers instead of primes?
    - Euclid's theorem
  - Generate my own primes

- General
  - Split tests into fast/slow
